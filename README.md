# bookbot: Text Analysis Project

## Project Overview

This Python project is designed to analyze the textual content of a book. Specifically, it focuses on Mary Shelley's *Frankenstein*, but can be adapted to other texts. The program performs several key tasks:

1. **Text Retrieval**: It reads the complete text of the book from a specified file.
2. **Word Count**: It calculates the total number of words in the text.
3. **Character Frequency Analysis**: It generates a dictionary of alphabetic characters with their corresponding frequency of appearance in the text, ignoring case distinctions.
4. **Data Sorting**: It sorts characters by their frequency in descending order.
5. **Reporting**: It prints a detailed report that includes the total word count and the frequency of each character.

## Main Features

- Retrieve and process text data from a file.
- Compute and display the total word count of the document.
- Analyze and report the frequency of each character in the document.
- Utilize basic file handling, string operations, and data structure manipulation in Python.

## Usage

The script is executed by running the `main()` function, which orchestrates the text analysis and reporting process. Ensure the text file (`frankenstein.txt`) is placed under `books/` directory relative to the script for it to function properly.

This project is ideal for those interested in text analysis, learning Python basics, or exploring data handling and reporting techniques.

## Credits
This project was inspired by and developed under the guidance of the boot.dev course. Special thanks to Lane, the team and community of [boot.dev](boot.dev) for their invaluable insights and expertise which greatly enhanced the quality of this work.
